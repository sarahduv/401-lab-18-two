Create an event driven application that “distributes” the responsibility for logging to a separate server via Socket.io , using only events to trigger logging based on activity.

#### Getting Started
- app.js
- Accepts a filename as a command line parameter
- Reads the file from the file system
- Converts it’s contents to upper case
- Writes it back to the file system

#### Requirements
- Refactor the provided application (app.js) using best practices for modularization, asynchronous file access, and test-ability.
- Connect the application (app.js) to a socket.io server and emit messages related to file access. Connect a new application (logger) to the server and log all file activity.

#### Assignment
- The application must accept a filename as a command line parameter
- Read the file from the file system
- Convert it’s contents to upper case
- Write it back to the file system
- Following the write operation, report back to the user (console.log) the status
- Any and all errors must be thrown

#### Server
- Create a socket.io server in a new folder called server
- Setup listeners for file-save and file-error events
- When they occur, emit() the appropriate event and payload to clients (specifically, the ‘logger’ will pick this up)

#### Logger
- Create a socket.io server for logging in a new folder called logger
- Connect the logger to the socket.io server
- Listen for file-save and file-error events
- console.log() both error and save messages

#### Application
- Create an application folder called app)
- Connect your app to the socket.io server
- Refactor the app to be modular, testable, and clean
- Read/Write should be done in promises, not callbacks
- File Reading/Writing/Upper-casing should happen in one module
- Each operation should be in a separate function
- Rather than throwing errors and console.log() inline, fire file-error and file-save events to the server that you connected to

#### Operations
- Start your server on port 3001
- In a separate terminal window, start your logger (it should connect to the server)
- In a separate terminal window, run the application from the CLI to alter the file
- You should observe the event stream in the client and errors on the server

#### Testing
- app - Write tests around all of your units
- File Read, File Save, Uppercase
- Mock the fs module methods so that your tests don’t use actual files
- logger - Test event handler functions (not event listeners themselves)
- Use spies to help testing your logger methods (assert that console.log was called right)
